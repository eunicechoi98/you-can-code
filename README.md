# you-can-code
Are you curious about programming? Awesome! I just want to let you know that you can do it. Here are all the resources I narrowed down to that helped me understand what coding is, how to think around a problem, and how to code.

# The Fundamentals
I think building the basic fundamental understading of coding is the most important step to leardning programming. It's like, if you don't know what + or - symbols mean in an equation, you can't start to solve math problems! So this is the step where I learned **how** to piece together the puzzle pieces to later understand what the puzzle pieces together represents (code).
1. How do computers work?

2. How does the internet work?

3. How does code work in real life (web application as an example)?
Personally, reading these two helped me to piece together how frontend, backend, data come together to be shown to the world:

* Frontend Development: https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/beginners-guide-to-front-end-development/



## Data Structures
Read through all of the data structures she introduces, you won't not understand your data structures after reading them!

Draw the data structure out on a paper as you go through these, you will have an easier time understanding them! Once you understand *what* the data structures are, then you can read deeper into how you can apply them by searching different applications of them yourself!

## Algorithms
* Videos: Just know that if you get through the entire Algorithms course on Khan Academy, you have just learned the entire 4 months of Algorithms class in junior year CS! The best part is, you can get through this in less than a week ! https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms
* Articles: This is the *best* blog e.v.e.r. If you read her articles, you won't not understand your algorithms!

All the most basic things to know before you dive into coding! Get through all of these and you will be ready to do some mean coding: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/programming-101

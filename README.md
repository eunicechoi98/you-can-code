Are you curious about programming? Awesome! I just want to let you know that you can do it. Here are all the resources I narrowed down to that helped me understand what coding is, how to think around a problem, and how to code.

# The Fundamentals
I think building the basic fundamental understading of coding is the most important step to leardning programming. It's like, if you don't know what + or - symbols mean in an equation, you can't start to solve math problems!

## Data Structures
Read through all of the data structures she introduces, you won't not understand your data structures after reading them!

Draw the data structure out on a paper as you go through these, you will have an easier time understanding them! Once you understand *what* the data structures are, then you can read deeper into how you can apply them by searching different applications of them yourself!

## Algorithms
* Videos: Just know that if you get through the entire Algorithms course on Khan Academy, you have just learned the entire 4 months of Algorithms class in junior year CS! The best part is, you can get through this in less than a week ! https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms
* Articles: This is the *best* blog e.v.e.r. If you read her articles, you won't not understand your algorithms!
